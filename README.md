# PicoCTF Writeups

Welcome to my PicoCTF Writeups repository! This repository contains my solutions and explanations for challenges from PicoCTF, a beginner-friendly cybersecurity competition designed to help individuals develop their skills in ethical hacking, cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and more.

## About PicoCTF

[PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. It provides a variety of challenges across different cybersecurity topics, making it an excellent platform for learning and improving cybersecurity skills.

## Repository Structure

The write-ups are organized by main category and then by difficulty:
