**ASCII Numbers - picoCTF Challenge Write-Up**

When participating in **picoCTF** or other cybersecurity challenges, you may come across hexadecimal representations of ASCII text. The challenge **"ASCII Numbers"** involves decoding a given hex string into readable text. One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is by using **CyberChef**, an open-source web-based tool for data transformation.

### **Understanding Hexadecimal Encoding**
Hexadecimal (base 16) is a numerical system commonly used in computing and cryptography. Each hex pair (two hex digits) represents one ASCII character. For example:
- `0x41` in hex corresponds to `A` in ASCII.
- `0x30` in hex corresponds to `0` in ASCII.

### **Solving the ASCII Numbers Challenge with CyberChef**
CyberChef simplifies the process of decoding hexadecimal strings into ASCII characters. Follow these steps to solve the challenge:

1. **Access CyberChef**  
   Go to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

2. **Insert the Given Hexadecimal String**  
   Paste the provided hexadecimal string into the **Input** field:
   ```
   0x70 0x69 0x63 0x6f 0x43 0x54 0x46 0x7b 0x34 0x35 0x63 0x31 0x31 0x5f 0x6e 0x30 0x5f 0x71 0x75 0x33 0x35 0x37 0x31 0x30 0x6e 0x35 0x5f 0x31 0x6c 0x6c 0x5f 0x74 0x33 0x31 0x31 0x5f 0x79 0x33 0x5f 0x6e 0x30 0x5f 0x6c 0x31 0x33 0x35 0x5f 0x34 0x34 0x35 0x64 0x34 0x31 0x38 0x30 0x7d
   ```

3. **Apply the "From Hex" Operation**  
   - In the **Recipe** panel, search for and add the **"From Hex"** operation.
   - Set the option to `Auto` or `Space-separated bytes` (if necessary).

4. **View the Output**  
   CyberChef will instantly decode the hexadecimal values into readable ASCII text. In this case, the output is:
   ```
   picoCTF{45c11_n0_qu35710n5_1ll_t311_y3_n0_l135_445d4180}
   ```
   This is the **flag** needed to complete the challenge.

### **Conclusion**
Understanding how to decode hexadecimal encoding into ASCII is an essential skill for CTF competitions and cybersecurity in general. With CyberChef, this process is quick and efficient. Now that you know how to solve the **ASCII Numbers** challenge, try applying this method to other similar challenges and enhance your skills!
