# Useless Challenge Walkthrough

So, you've just SSH'd into the server and are staring at your terminal, unsure of what to do next. Don't worry! This guide will walk you through every step to solve the 'useless' challenge. Let's get started.

## Step 1: Identifying the Script
After connecting to the server, you'll notice a file named `useless`. The first thing you should always do when encountering an unfamiliar file is to determine its type. To do this, use the `file` command:

```sh
file useless
```

This command will tell you what kind of file you're dealing with. In this case, it will likely indicate that `useless` is some kind of script or executable.

## Step 2: Examining the File Contents
Once you've determined it's a script, the next logical step is to inspect its contents. You can do this using the `cat` command:

```sh
cat useless
```

At this point, the script will output something seemingly cryptic. However, it provides you with a hint—it tells you to "read the manual."

## Step 3: Reading the Manual
When a program suggests reading the manual, it's referring to the `man` command, which allows you to access the manual pages for various commands and utilities. Let's try running:

```sh
man useless
```

Surprisingly, this works! Normally, many challenge scripts don't have dedicated manual pages, but in this case, one has been cleverly provided for you.

## Step 4: Finding the Flag
Now, carefully read through the manual page. Somewhere within the text, the flag is hidden. It might be disguised within a description, example usage, or even as an "error message." Scroll through the manual output and look for anything that resembles the format of a flag.

Once you find it, congratulations! You've successfully completed the 'useless' challenge. This challenge is a great reminder that sometimes, the simplest solutions—like checking the manual—are the most effective.

### Recap:
1. Use `file useless` to check the file type.
2. Use `cat useless` to see what it says.
3. Follow the hint and run `man useless`.
4. Read carefully and find the flag!

Keep this methodical approach in mind, as it will serve you well in future challenges. Happy hacking!
