## Vault Door Training

### Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you are provided with a file that can be downloaded using `wget`. Once downloaded, you must inspect its contents to uncover a solution. This challenge tests basic command-line skills and the ability to analyze source code.

### Steps to Solve
1. **Download the file**: Use `wget` to retrieve the challenge file.
   ```sh
   wget <file_url>
   ```
   Replace `<file_url>` with the actual URL provided in the challenge.

2. **Inspect the file**: Use commands such as `cat`, `less`, or `strings` to view its contents.
   ```sh
   cat filename
   ```
   ```sh
   less filename
   ```
   ```sh
   strings filename
   ```

3. **Analyze the source code**: If the file contains a script or program, carefully read through the code to identify any embedded hints or logic that reveals the solution.

4. **Extract the key**: Look for hardcoded passwords, encoded messages, or specific logic that needs to be reversed to obtain the required solution.

5. **Submit the flag**: Once the key or flag is found, submit it according to the challenge instructions.

### Tools Required
- Terminal/Command Line
- `wget`
- `cat`, `less`, `strings`
- Basic programming knowledge (if source code analysis is required)

This challenge is a great introduction to analyzing files and understanding simple security mechanisms.
