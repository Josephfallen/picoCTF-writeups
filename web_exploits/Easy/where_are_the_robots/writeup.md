For the challenge "Where Are the Robots," think of it like a treasure hunt on a website! Websites have a special file called `robots.txt` that tells search engines which pages they should not show in search results. But guess what? You can still visit those pages if you know where to look!

Here’s how you can find the hidden page:

1. Type the website’s address and add `/robots.txt` at the end (e.g., `http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474/robots.txt`).
2. This will show a list of pages that the website doesn’t want search engines to look at. Look for anything that says `Disallow`—that means the page is hidden from search engines!
3. Copy the hidden page’s link and open it in your browser.
4. Once you’re there, search for the flag, like a hidden message in a secret room.

Good luck on your hunt!
